# <My-Portfolio-Website>

## Description

This is my website portfolio to showcase my projects. It was also my first experience using react which proved to be somewhat challenging but it has opened the door up to interest new libraries and frameworks. For future purpose I may learn to experiment with frameworks such as Vue instead for simplicity sake. However it allowed for better modularization and seperation of work tasks.
